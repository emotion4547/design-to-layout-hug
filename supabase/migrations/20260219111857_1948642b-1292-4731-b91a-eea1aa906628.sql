-- Fix: Drop restrictive INSERT policy and recreate as permissive
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anyone can create orders" ON public.orders;
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can create orders" ON public.orders
  FOR INSERT TO anon, authenticated
  WITH CHECK (true);

-- Same fix for order_items
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anyone can create order items" ON public.order_items;
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can create order items" ON public.order_items
  FOR INSERT TO anon, authenticated
  WITH CHECK (true);
